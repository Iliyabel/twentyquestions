Twenty Questions AI Game - Terminal Based

## About The Project
Twenty Questions is a terminal-based game that uses a simple AI to figure out your item. The AI has access to a binary search tree database of questions and answers to them. When it guesses incorrectly, it will ask what your item is and if you can provide a question to distinguish it from its guess. It will then record your answer and add it to the tree and grow the database.
